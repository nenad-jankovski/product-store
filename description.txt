Develop a small, focused REST API with Spring Boot that performs the following:

Data Model:

A simple entity (e.g., "Product" with attributes like id, name, description, price)

CRUD Endpoints:
Create a new product
Retrieve a list of all products
Retrieve a product by its ID
Update an existing product
Delete a product

Persistence:
Use an in-memory database (such as H2) for simplicity. Focus is on API and Spring Boot concepts, not production database setup.

Validation
Basic input validation (e.g., not-empty fields, price greater than zero).
Simple error handling for invalid requests (e.g., returning appropriate HTTP status codes).
